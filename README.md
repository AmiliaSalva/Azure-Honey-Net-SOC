## Introduction

 I am thrilled to present my latest project, which focuses on building a honeynet in Azure to simulate real-world cyber attacks. 
This project showcases my skills in Azure security, incident response, and environment hardening

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to deploy intentionally vulnerable virtual machines within the Azure infrastructure to attract and study cyber attacks. This allowed me to analyze attackers' tactics and techniques, while also demonstrating my ability to respond effectively and remediate identified issues.

## Technologies, Regulations, and Azure Components Employed:

- Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- Azure Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2x Windows, 1x Linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace with Kusto Query Language (KQL) Queries
- Azure Key Vault for Secure Secrets Management
- Azure Storage Account for Data Storage
- Microsoft Sentinel for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Protect Cloud Resources
- Windows Remote Desktop for Remote Access
- Command Line Interface (CLI) for System Management
- PowerShell for Automation and Configuration Management
- NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 for Security Controls
- NIST SP 800-61 Revision 2 for Incident Handling Guidance

## Methodology

- <b>*Creating the honeynet*</b>: I began by deploying multiple vulnerable virtual machines in Azure, simulating an insecure environment.

- <b>*Monitoring and analysis*</b>: Azure was configured to ingest log sources from various resources into a log analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was then used to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents based on the collected data.

- <b>*Security metrics measurement*</b>: I observed the environment for 24 hours, recording key security metrics while it was insecure. This provided a baseline to compare against after implementing remediation measures.

- <b>*Incident response and remediation*</b>: After addressing the incidents and identifying vulnerabilities, I began the process of hardening the environment by applying security best practices and Azure-specific recommendations.

- <b>*Post-remediation analysis*</b>: I re-observed the environment for another 24 hours to measure security metrics again, comparing the results with the initial baseline.

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were originally deployed, exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open, and all other resources are deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet; aka, no use for Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-03-15 17:04:29
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 19470
| Syslog                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 348
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 843

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures. It is noteworthy that the number of security events and incidents were drastially reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness.

It is worth noting that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
